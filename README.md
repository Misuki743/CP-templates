# TODO

- add chmin/chmax to default template
- chromatic polynomial/number

# MAYBE, IF I HAVE NOTHING TO DO

- actedMonoid for linear add/sum query
- lichaoSegmentTree
- actedmonoid: add addHisMin/addHisMax/addHisSum
- link-cut tree
- fix static top tree 1, seems current way to decompose the tree can't handle ABC351G well :/

# TODO

- add chmin/chmax to default template
- chromatic polynomial/number
- min plus convolution
- refine arbitrary mod template

# MAYBE, IF I HAVE NOTHING TO DO

- actedMonoid for linear add/sum query
- doubling(support mataining commutative monoid)
- lichaoSegmentTree
- actedmonoid: add addHisMin/addHisMax/addHisSum
- bigInt(I don't want to write this D:)
- link-cut tree
- fix static top tree 1, seems current way to decompose the tree can't handle ABC351G well :/

# TODO

- use this (https://github.com/online-judge-tools/verification-helper)
- doubling(support mataining commutative monoid)
- rolling hash
- add lower bound parameter to MCMF::addEdge
- coordinate compression
- various shortest path algorithm
- virtual tree
- wavelet matrix
- relax convolution
- add jumping array for Aho-Corasick and palindromic tree

# MAYBE, IF I HAVE NOTHING TO DO

- BostanMori: implement the one that keeps polynomials in DFT form during process
- rewrite treap/persistent treap to support mataining monoid
- rewrite HLD to make it works on non-commutative monoid
- lichaoSegmentTree
- ultraLazySegmentTree: add addHisMin/addHisMax
- bigInt(I don't want to write this D:)

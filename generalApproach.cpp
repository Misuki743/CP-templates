 * note: these may be useful when I have completely no idea on a problem D:
 *
 * draw a graph
 *
 * try to model the problem in the most general way
 *
 * find invariant
 *
 * find equivalent condition
 *
 * observe a lower/upper bound, and try to achieve that bound
 *
 * observe optimal structure
 *
 * invent subtask
 *
 * extreme principle
 *
 * think what is important in the problem model
 *
 * think reversely
 *
 * brute force small cases

 * read the problem carefully, inputs/outputs are part of the problem!
 *
 * don't take too much time to find pattern, try to use your brain to think!
 * make sure your idea is 99% correct then start to think impl!
 * think fully about the impl(ex. what DS will I use) then go to impl!
 *
 * reread the code before submitting!
 * always check code/solution/overflow when getting WA!
 * don't panik when the thing goes not well!
